# Global COVID-19 Certificate Network (GCCN)

## Background

The Digital TRUST Infrastructure for Discovery and Validation (Regi-TRUST), is an infrastructure to locate existing COVID-19 certificate issuers and issuing networks, collate COVID-19 certificate policies, and list trusted issuers and access their public keys for certificate verifications, establishing trust interoperability among COVID certificate networks. Regi-TRUST was originally started by the Linux Foundation in 2021 as the Global COVID-19 Certificate Network (GCCN), and is now sponsored and hosted by the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP). 

Implementers of Regi-Trust can leverage tools provided to create purpose-sized networks of trusted digital services operated by all types of entities. As a result, users will be able to easily discover services in need, access relevant service information through trusted endpoints and make informed decisions about whether to trust and use a service. The decentralized and cloud-agnostic architecture of Regi-TRUST lends itself to scalability and allows users to maintain sovereignty and control over their own systems and data, providing the necessary trust infrastructure. 

Regi-TRUST is built on the open-source [Trust mAnagement INfrasstructure (TRAIN)](https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure/fraunhofer/train_project_summary), developed by the Fraunhofer IAO as a part of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) Lab. TRAIN uses/supports several established standards and is flexible with existing architectures, providing technical accessibility and inclusivity for implementors. 

## GCCN Proof of Concept

The original GCCN proof of concept involved 1) onboarding members to the network and 2) the verification of COVID certificates using the network. For more detail on execution of this proof of concept and results, [please follow this link.](https://www.lfph.io/2022/04/19/lfph-completes-the-proof-of-concept-of-its-gccn-trust-registry-network/)

## Implementation Toolkit and Technical Specification

The Regi-TRUST infrastructure intends to develop and provide a suite of tools to enable the discovery and validation of trusted services. [Contents of the original implementation toolkit is stated here](https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/) ahead of completion of the GCCN pilot. Full technical specifications, implementation guides, and more are forthcoming.
