This Implementation Guide (IG) acts as the computable representation of the core data elements in the published guidance, mapped to standard terminologies. These data models, in the form of FHIR logical models, and terminologies, in the form of FHIR value sets, are the basis for interoperability between the various credential formats. The IG provides FHIR Structure Maps and Concept Maps to define transformations between supported credential formats and the core data set, which allows business rules to execute against a common set of data elements.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"gateway":{"id":"gateway","title":"Trust Gateway","description":"Purpose","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"In response to COVID-19, Governments and organizations across the world have developed and adopted standards and technologies to create, present, and verify digital vaccination credentials.
